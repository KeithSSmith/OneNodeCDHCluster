# One Node EDGE2AI CDH Cluster

This script automatically sets up a CDH cluster on the public cloud on a single VM with the following 14 services:

- CDSW
- NiFi
- NiFi CA
- NiFi Registry
- Kafka
- Kudu
- Impala
- Hue
- Hive
- Spark
- Oozie
- HDFS
- YARN
- ZK

More services can be added or removed by updating the template used.

As this cluster is meant to be used for demos, experimenting, training, and workshops, it doesn't setup Kerberos and TLS.

## Instructions

Below are instructions for creating the cluster with or without CDSW service. CDSW requires some extra resources (more powerful instance, and a secondary disk for the docker device).

### Provisioning Cluster without CDSW
- Create a Centos 7 VM with at least 4 vCPUs/ 16GB RAM.
- OS disk size: at least 50 GB.

### Provisioning Cluster with CDSW
- Create a Centos 7 VM with at least 8 vCPUs/ 32GB RAM.
- OS disk size: at least 100 GB.
- Docker device disk: at least 200GB SSD disk.
  - Node: you need a fast disk more than you need a large disk: aim for a disk with 3000 IOPS. This might mean choosing a 1TB disk.

### Configuration and installation
- If you created the VM on Azure and need to resize the OS disk, here are the [instructions](how-to-resize-os-disk.md).
- add inbound rule to the Security Group to allow your IP only, for all ports.
- ssh into VM and copy this repo.

```
$ sudo su -
$ yum install -y git
$ git clone https://github.com/fabiog1901/OneNodeCDHCluster.git
$ cd OneNodeCDHCluster
$ chmod +x setup.sh
```

The script `setup.sh` takes 3 arguments:
- the cloud provider name: `aws`,`azure`,`gcp`.
- the template file.
- OPTIONAL the Docker Device disk mount point.

Example: create cluster without CDSW on AWS using default_template.json
```
$ ./setup.sh aws default_template.json
```

Example: create cluster with CDSW on Azure using cdsw_template.json
```
$ ./setup.sh azure cdsw_template.json /dev/sdc
```

Wait until the script finishes, check for any error.

## Use

Once the script returns, you can open Cloudera Manager at [http://\<public-IP\>:7180](http://<public-IP>:7180)

Wait for about 20-30 mins for CDSW to be ready. You can monitor the status of CDSW by issuing the `cdsw-status` command.

You can use `kubectl get pods -n kube-system` to check if all the pods that the role `Master` is suppose to start have really started.

You can also check the CDSW deployment status on CM > CDSW service > Instances > Master role > Processes > stdout.

## Troubleshooting and known issues

- CDSW service will issue a red alert `HTTP port check timed out after 60 seconds.`. You can disregard that, or add the instance IP to the Security Group, so that inbound traffic from the instance's own IP address is allowed.

### Docker device

To find out what the docker device mount point is, use `lsblk`. See below examples:


AWS, using a M5.2xlarge
```
$ lsblk
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
nvme0n1     259:1    0  100G  0 disk
+-nvme0n1p1 259:2    0  100G  0 part /
nvme1n1     259:0    0  200G  0 disk

$ ./setup.sh aws cdsw_template.json /dev/nvme1n1
```

Azure Standard DS4 v2
```
$ lsblk
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
fd0      2:0    1    4K  0 disk
sda      8:0    0   30G  0 disk
+-sda1   8:1    0  500M  0 part /boot
+-sda2   8:2    0 29.5G  0 part /
sdb      8:16   0   56G  0 disk
+-sdb1   8:17   0   56G  0 part /mnt/resource
sdc      8:32   0  200G  0 disk
sr0     11:0    1  628K  0 rom

$ ./setup.sh azure cdsw_template.json /dev/sdc
```

GCP n1-standard-8
```
$ lsblk
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda      8:0    0  100G  0 disk
└─sda1   8:1    0  100G  0 part /
sdb      8:16   0  200G  0 disk

$ ./setup.sh gcp cdsw_template.json /dev/sdb
```
